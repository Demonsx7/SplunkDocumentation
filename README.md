<h1>Splunk Data Analysis Configuration Documentation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project documents a data analysis process which was developed using a pre-developed dataset of fraudulent transactions from CommonWealth Bank. Through Splunk a variety of search rules were added into the system to generate a visually appealing dataset view which makes it easier to identify the common merchant targets surrounding fradulent transactions within CommonWealth Bank. <br /> <br/> The work demonstrates my ability to utilise Splunk to configure and develop a data anaylsis dashboard to identify trends across fradulent transactions within an organisation, this knowledge is critical within cybersecurity to promptly identify core aspects for improvements. <br /> <br/> This Splunk data analysis dashboard demonstrates my ability to develop data analysis tools using my practical experience in Splunk.
